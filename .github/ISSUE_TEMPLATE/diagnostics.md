<!--
Thank you for filing a bug report! Please provide a short summary of the
bug, along with any information you feel relevant to replicating the
bug.

If you cannot produce a minimal reproduction case (something that would
work in isolation), please provide the steps or even link to a
repository that causes the problematic output to occur.
-->

Given the following code:
<!--
Please provide a link to your library if it's more than a single script.
-->

```py
<code>
```

The current output is:

```
<csdl output>
```

<!-- The following is not always necessary. -->
Ideally the output should look like:

```
<proposed output>
```

<!--
If the problem is not self-explanatory, please provide a rationale for the
change.
-->

<!--
If dramatically different output is caused by small changes, consider also
adding them here.

If you're not using the version of the compiler on the `master` branch,
you should also check if the bug also exists in the version on the
`master` branch.
-->
