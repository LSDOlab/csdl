Array Indexing
==============

``csdl`` supports indexing into ``Variable`` objects for explicit
outputs.

In this example, integer indices are used to concatenate multiple
expressions/variables into one variable and extract values from a single
variable representing an array.

The variable representing the array, `'x'`, is created with the
``Model.create_output`` method.
Array index assignments are then used to define ``'x'`` in terms of
other CSDL variables.

Note: For every variable created with ``Model.create_output``, there is no
need to call ``Model.register_output``.

``csdl`` supports specifying ranges as well as individual indices to
slice and concatenate arrays.

``csdl`` supports specifying ranges along multiple axes as well as
individual indices and ranges to slice and concatenate arrays.
