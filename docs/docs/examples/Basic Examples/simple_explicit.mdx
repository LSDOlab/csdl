Simple Explicit Expressions
===========================

In this example, we define some variables that are computed explicitly,
and regiser those variables as outputs.
Each output in this example is computed explicitly using the basic
mathematical operations.
The example below is described as follows.

``Model.declare_variable`` returns a ``Variable`` object, which
represents a value that comes from outside the current model, either as
an output of a parent model (a model that is above the current model in
the model hierarchy), or an output of a child model (a model that is
below the current model in the model hierarchy).

Some variables are defined using mathematical expressions, and finally,
each output is registered.
To register an output of the model, use the ``Model.register_output``
method.
``Model.register_output`` requires a name that the CSDL compiler back end
will use to access the variable output.
This name does not need to be the same as the Python variable name, but
it's good practice to stay consistent.
The CSDL compiler back end has no knowledge of the Python variable name,
only the name provided in methods like ``Model.create_input``,
``Model.declare_variable``, and ``Model.register_output``.
