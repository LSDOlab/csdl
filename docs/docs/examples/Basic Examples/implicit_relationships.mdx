Implicit Relationships
======================

The ``ImplicitOperation`` class provides users with a way to solve for
variables in implicit relationships.
It is possible to compute outputs implicitly by defining a residual
variable in terms of the output and inputs.

In the first example, we solve a quadratic equation.
This quadratic has two solutions: ``1`` and ``3``.
Depending on the starting value of the output variable, CSDL will
find one root or the other.
The second and third examples show how to perform a bracketed search.

```py
from csdl.examples.valid.ex_implicit_apply_nonlinear import example
from csdl_om import Simulator
sim = example(Simulator)

print('using default x=1')
sim.run()
print('x', sim['x'].shape)
print(sim['x'])

print('')
print('')
print('setting x=1.9')
sim['x'] = 1.9
sim.run()
print('x', sim['x'].shape)
print(sim['x'])

print('')
print('')
print('setting x=2.1')
sim['x'] = 2.1
sim.run()
print('x', sim['x'].shape)
print(sim['x'])
```

The expressions for the residuals will will be part of a ``Model``
within the generated ``ImplicitOperation`` object.

For problems where the residual may converge for multiple solutions, or
where the residual is difficult to converge over some interval, ``csdl``
provides an API for bracketing solutions.

Brackets may also be specified for multidimensional array values.
