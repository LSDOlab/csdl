------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section presents a first look at an example of a model defined
using CSDL.
The example shown in this section only shows some basic features of
CSDL, and we will only be discussing them at a high level in this
section.
Later, we'll go over the basic features in more detail, including
defining and solving optimization problems, as well as more advanced
features.

## The Compilation Process

CSDL simulations are written, compiled, and run within a Python script.
The code snippet below shows the definition, compilation, and execution
of a basic simulation built using CSDL.
We will discuss and build upon this example throughout this section.
The complete example appears at the end of this section.

```py
from csdl import Model
import csdl

class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        # model specification (not blank)
        # ...

from csdl_om import Simulator

sim = Simulator(Example())

sim.run()
print(sim[...])
print(sim[...])
print(sim[...])
```

First, this script defines a class, `Example`, which inherits from
`Model`, which is part of the `csdl` package.
Second, an object `sim` of class `Simulator` is constructed from an
instance of `Example`.
Third, `sim.run()` is executed, and the script prints the result.

Before looking at the definition of `Example` or the usage of either
`Example` or `Simulator`, it is important to understand the role
that these two classes play in this example, and the role that `Model`
and `Simulator` play in all programs written in CSDL.

The `Example` class is a user defined class, where the user supplies a
mathematical specification of the model we are interested in simulating.
The `Example` class is not capable of running a full simulation or
computing derivatives for use in solving an optimiztion problem -- it is
simply a description of the physical system.
To run a simulation, we need to construct an executable object that
performs the simulation.

As stated in the [Installation Instructions](/docs/tutorial/install), we
need a separate package to provide the `Simulator` class, which contains
the compiler back end.
The reason for this is that the CSDL compiler is a three stage compiler.
Three stage compilers are split between a front end, which generates an
intermediate representation of the code, a middle end, which performs
implementation-independent optimizations on the generated intermediate
representation, and a back end, which generates executable code.
The `csdl` package implements the front end and middle end in the
`Model` class, while a separate package implements the back end in the
`Simulator` class.
This creates a clean separation between model specification and
simulation implementation.
This separation is central to creating a language where users can
operate at the highest level of abstraction possible.

:::important
Although Python is an interpreted language, and CSDL code is written in
Python, CSDL is a compiled language.
The two separate commands to initiate the compilation process and run
the resulting executable object merely takes place _within_ Python, but
the `Simulator` class
_is not required to be implemented in any language in particular_.
:::

Now, let's look at how to specify models in CSDL.

## Model Specification

To specify a model, create a new class that inherits from `Model`.
The `Model` class is the base class for all classes where a
mathematical model of a system is specified.
The `Model.define` method is where the mathematical model is
specified.
This is where most CSDL code is written, except for some advanced use
cases that we'll cover later.

```py
class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        p = self.declare_variable('p', shape=(2,))
        x = p[0]
        y = p[1]

        distance = (x**2 + y**2)**(1/2)

        self.register_output('distance', distance)
```

Here we declare a variable named `'p'` with shape `(2,)`.
The name `'p'` is the CSDL name of the variable.
This name is the name used to access data within the generated
executable object contained in `sim`.
CSDL has no knowledge of Python names, so variables must be given a
name as a string so that the resulting run time values may be accessed
later.
Then we create two new variables, `x` and `y` from `p`.
These variables _do not_ have a name in CSDL.
They will not be accessible via the `Simulator` API.

Next, we compute a distance, `distance`, using the normal mathematical
operations available in Python (aka special methods).
This variable does not have a name until we register it as an output
using `Model.register_output`.

:::note
We could also compute the distance using
`distance = csdl.norm(p)`.
:::

:::important
When using Python special methods, CSDL variables behave mostly like
NumPy arrays, except that CSDL variables are immutable and do not
support [broadcasting](/docs/troubleshooting#broadcasting).
:::

Sometimes it is desireable to store values from multiple variables in
one variable.
For this we use the `Model.create_output` method:

```py
class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        p = self.declare_variable('p', shape=(2,))
        x = p[0]
        y = p[1]

        distance = (x**2 + y**2)**(1/2)

        self.register_output('distance', distance)

        q = self.create_output('q', shape=(3,))
        q[:2] = p
        q[-1] = distance
```

Here, `q` is named `'q'`, and its value is defined after `q` is
constructed.
In this case, `q` stores `p` (the position vector in $x-y$ coordinates)
and `distance`.

:::important
Variable objects created using `Model` methods do not store run time
values, as the `Model` class cannot run a full simulation.
Instead, variable objects store a history of operations.
This history is the intermediate representation that `Model` constructs
at compile time.
:::

:::important
Only variables created using `Model.create_output` can use indexed
assignment.
The indices from multiple assignments must not overlap.
:::

## Simulation Implementation

To construct a simulation implementation from the mathematical
specification defined in `Example`, we need to construct an object of
the `Simulator` class, which comes from a package separate from `csdl`;
in this case, `csdl_om`.
The `Simulator` class constructor always requires an instance of the
`Model` class or any of its subclasses, so we provide it with an
instance of `Example`.

Once an object of the `Simulator` class is constructed (in this example,
`sim`), the compilation process is complete, and we can run a
simulation.
The `sim` object can also compute derivatives automatically, so if an
optimization problem is defined (shown later in this tutorial), an
external optimizer can be connected to `sim` to solve the optimization
problem.

:::note
The compilation process can be as simple as a single line of code within
a Python script,

```py
sim = Simulator(Example(...))
```

and running the compiled code is as easy as,

```py
sim.run()
```
:::

Because of the way the roles are split between `Model` and
`Simulator`, creating an instance of a `Model` (or in this example,
`Example`) class does not construct an object that can simulate the
behavior of a physical system.


## Making Models Generic

So far, the `Example` class only defines a single model.
Multiple instances of `Example` would result in a simulation that
behaves the exact same way.
We can make `Example` more _generic_ by defining model parameters.
To define model parameters, define a `Model.initialize` method.

```py
class Example(Model):
    def initialize(self):
        self.parameters.declare('scale', types=float, default=1)
        self.parameters.declare('in_name', types=str)
        self.parameters.declare('out_name', types=str)
```

Model parameters are neither inputs to the model, nor are they computed
by the model.
Instead, model parameters make model definitions more generic.
Note that defining an `initialize` method is entirely optional.
In this case, users of `Example` are free to choose the name of an
input variable and an output variable, as well as the value of some
number called `'scale'`.
If the `default` option is not defined, then the parameter is required.

To use the parameters within the model definition,

```py
class Example(Model):
    def initialize(self):
        self.parameters.declare('scale', types=float, default=1)
        self.parameters.declare('in_name', types=str)
        self.parameters.declare('out_name', types=str)

    def define(self):
        scale = self.parameters['scale']
        in_name = self.parameters['in_name']
        out_name = self.parameters['out_name']

        # now we can use these parameters...
```

You'll notice that the parameters defined in the `initialize` method
are accessed in the `define` method.
The `initialize` method is always called before the `define` method,
and all parameters declared in `initialize` are available by the time
`define` is called.
That is, you will always have access to parameters within the `define`
method.

To change the definition of `Example` for only one instance of
`Example`, pass the values of the parameters as named arguments to the
constructor:

```py
e1 = Example(in_name='a', out_name='b')
e2 = Example(in_name='a', out_name='b', scale=10)
e3 = Example(in_name='r', out_name='s')
e4 = Example(in_name='s', out_name='r', scale=10)
```

## The Complete Example

Looking at the complete example, we see that the variables `p` and `q`
now have CSDL names that are specified only when `Example` is
instantiated.
We also see that `q[:2]` is equal to the position, scaled by a factor
`scale`.

```py
from csdl import Model
import csdl

class Example(Model):
    def initialize(self):
        self.parameters.declare('scale', types=float, default=1)
        self.parameters.declare('in_name', types=str)
        self.parameters.declare('out_name', types=str)

    def define(self):
        scale = self.parameters['scale']
        in_name = self.parameters['in_name']
        out_name = self.parameters['out_name']

        p = self.declare_variable(in_name, shape=(2,))
        x = p[0]
        y = p[1]

        distance = (x**2 + y**2)**(1/2)

        self.register_output('distance', distance)

        q = self.create_output(out_name, shape=(3,))
        q[:2] = scale*p
        q[-1] = distance

from csdl_om import Simulator

in_name = 't'
out_name = 'u'
sim = Simulator(Example(in_name='t', out_name='u'))

sim.run()
print(sim[in_name])
print(sim['distance'])
print(sim[out_name])
```

## Conclusion

This is only a taste of what CSDL has to offer, but it should be enough
to get you started building basic models that you could otherwise build
in Python.
In the next section, we'll cover the basic language concepts without
relying so much on examples.
Later, we'll dive deeper into the basics of CSDL, and move on to more
advanced features.
