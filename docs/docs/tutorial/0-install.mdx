title: Installation Instructions
---

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSDL compiler requires Python.
It is recommended to install Python using
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads)
or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

After installing Python, please install
1. [`csdl`](https://github.com/lsdolab/csdl)
2. A [CSDL compiler back end](../backends).

To install `csdl`, first clone the repository and install using `pip`.
From the terminal/command line,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lsdolab/csdl.git
pip install -e csdl/
```

To install a back end, please select a back end from from the
[List of Available Back Ends](../backends) and follow the installation
instructions for that package.

:::important
The CSDL compiler is composed of two packages, `csdl`, and a
compiler back end.
Simulation code cannot be generated or executed if only the `csdl`
package is installed.
:::

It is highly recommended to create a different environment for each
back end, as they may require different versions of `csdl`.

## Updating

To update `csdl` to the latest version,

```sh
cd path/to/csdl
git pull
```

:::note
On Windows, use `\` instead of `/`.
:::

:::important
Make sure to keep the back end(s) installed on your computer up to date
according to their update instructions.
:::

## Testing

`csdl` provides tests that are independent of the compiler back end
implementation.
That is, tests are implementation-agnostic.

To run all tests for the CSDL compiler, navigate to the directory
containing the `csdl` package and run

```sh
pytest -s --backend <backend>
```

where `<backend>` (including angle brackets) is the name of the
back end implementation.
Quotes are not required.

For example, if using `csdl_om` as the back end, run

```sh
pytest -s --backend csdl_om
```

:::note
The tests supplied by `csdl` do not run any tests specific to the back
end implementation.
:::

:::note
The `csdl_om` package supplies the compiler back end used to
generate all output generated from examples in this documentation.
:::

If all tests pass for one back end implementation, but not another, that
is an indication that the back end implementation that resulted in test
failures has a bug.

If the bug is an indication of lack of test coverage in the frontend,
new tests should be added to `csdl` to ensure compliance among all
back end implementations.

## Tools

To get the best experience using CSDL, use your favorite Python
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor with your
favorite extensions.

To install recommended tools, use

```sh
pip install yapf mypy isort
```

and follow the instructions for your IDE/text editor to integrate them
into your workflow.
