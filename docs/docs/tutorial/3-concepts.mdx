------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section covers the basic concepts of CSDL that you will need to
understand in order to write effective CSDL code.
In this section, you will learn about the basic object types (or
classes),

- Model
- Variable
- Operation

In addition to the basic classes, this section presents ideas for
understanding CSDL as a compiled language.
This tutorial will refer back to and build upon the concepts presented
in this section.

## Model

A CSDL model is a mathematical specification of a physical system.
The majority of user code is located in the definition for a user
defined class that inherits from the `Model` class.
Users can supply a mathematical specification using a functional
programming style, which resembles mathematical notation, to define a
model as a composition of functions.
Users can also supply a mathematical specification using an object
oriented programming style, to define a model as a composition of
models.
This composition defines a model hierarchy, where the top level model is
the "main" model, representing the entire system (e.g. a vehicle) and
the models further down the hierarchy represent subsystem, or
disciplines (e.g. aerodynamics, structures, propulsion).
The model hierarchy has a
[tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) structure;
each model has at most one parent, and any number of children.
Assembling a model hierarchy is done using the
[`Model.add`](/docs/lang_ref/model#add) method.
Connections between models are issued via the
[`Model.connect`](/docs/lang_ref/model#connect) method.
Connections represent equality between variables declared or defined in
different disciplines.
For example, one discipline could compute the load on a wing due to
aerodynamic forces, and another discipline could use that load as an
input to compute the wing deflection.

Users are free to define a model specification using a mix of the
functional and object oriented paradigms.
Model specifications are defined within the
[`Model.define`](/docs/lang_ref/model#define) method.
For example,

```py
from csdl import Model

class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        # mathematical specification goes here
```

:::note
The `Model` class and user defined subclasses _do not provide an
implementation_.
To generate an implementation, an object of the `Simulator` class must
be constructed from a `Model` object.
The `csdl` package supplies the `Model` class, while a separate package
chosen by the user supplies the `Simulator` class.
:::

## Variable

The concept of a variable in CSDL differs from the concept of a variable
in Python.
In Python, variables store _run time values_, e.g. `x=3`, or
`a=np.eye(3)`.
In CSDL, a variable stores the _history of previous operations and
variables_ used to define that variable.
The histories form a structure called a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
The nodes of the DAG are variables and operations.
This DAG structure forms and intermediate representation (IR) of the program.
Storing an IR of the program comes with many
benfits.
The CSDL IR can store properties of variables and
operations that the compiler can exploit, either before generating the
final executable, or during code generation.
For example, the compiler back end is free to implement derivative
computation for each operation, requiring no additional input from the
user.

:::note
Because CSDL variables do not store run time values, printing a CSDL
variable will not show its run time value.
In order to print a run time value for a variable, use the
[`Model.print_var`](/docs/lang_ref/model#print_var) method.
:::

CSDL variables can be used the same way Python variables are used.
For example,

```py
from csdl import Model
import csdl

class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        # construct csdl Variable objects
        x = self.declare_variable('x')
        m = self.declare_variable('m')
        b = self.declare_variable('b')

        # define new Variable objects just as Python variables are defined
        y = m*x**2 + b
        # call functions from CSDL standard library
        z = csdl.sin(x)

        # register variables as outputs to make CSDL aware of variable definitions
        self.register_output('y', y)
        self.register_output('z', z)
```

The next section, [Variable Types](types), will cover
[`Model.declare_variable`](/docs/lang_ref/model#declare_variable)  and
[`Model.register_output`](/docs/lang_ref/model#register_output) into
more detail.

:::note
CSDL variables have some limitations.
Unlike NumPy arrays, CSDL variables do not support broadcasting. In
order to perform elementwise multiplication, for example, a scalar
variable (array with shape `(1,)`) by a variable that represents a
vector, tensor, or matrix, users must use the `csdl.reshape` or
`csdl.expand` functions to make the shapes of the operands compatible.
:::

As mentioned in [Model](#model), CSDL users can use a functional or
object oriented style to define a model specification.
Defining variables in terms of other variables, or as functions of
variables, is how users define a model specification using the
functional programming style.
Most user defined models will use the functional programming style,
especially the simplest models.

Part of the functional style to keep in mind is that CSDL variables are
_immutable_; once a variable is defined, there is no way to express a
change (or mutation) in that variable's value at run time.
In some cases, variable values cannot be defined explicitly, rather,
they must be computed iteratively.
For example, a function $f(x,y)=0$ that takes $x$ as an input and whose
output is $y$ requires an iterative solution if the equation $f(x,y)=0$
cannot be rearranged so that $y$ is isolated to one side of the
equation.
In this case, a solver is required to mutate the value at run time until
a residual $r_y=f(x,y)$ converges within some tolerance.
CSDL does not require users to implement solvers, but does not allow run
time loops either; i.e.

```py
class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        x = self.declare_variable('x')
        while x - 0.5*x > 1e-6:
            x = 0.5*x
```

:::note
Python does not enforce immutability, so if a variable is redefined (or
in Python parlance, if a variable name is bound to a new reference),
then the object in memory storing the variable data is not in use in
later parts of the code.

## Operation

- [ ] TODO: finalze implicit API, discuss using implicit_operation

The concept of an operation in CSDL also serves to construct the IR.
Users do not interact with operations except when defining
[Custom Operations](/docs/tutorial/advanced#custom-operations), which is
covered in the [Advanced](/docs/tutorial/advanced) section of this
tutorial, but it is still useful at this stage to understand how the IR
is constructed when Python executes `Model.define`.
As mentioned in [Variable](#variable), the IR has the structure of a
DAG, where nodes represent either variables or operations.
Each operation node has at least one predecessor node of variable type,
and at least one successor node of variable type.
Each variable node has at most one predecessor node of operation type,
and zero or more successor nodes of operation type.

Operations can store properties, such as whether or not they are linear
operations, elementwise operations, posynomials, etc.
These properties are used for performing implementation-independent
optimizations/graph transformations on the IR.

Derivatives for operations provided by the standard library are also
implemented in the CSDL compiler back end.
Operation properties and derivatives are hidden from the user so that
code optimization and derivative implementation are automated, ensuring
that user code is clear and easily maintainable without sacrificing
performance of generated code.

## Simulator

The previous subsections describe (at a high level) how users define a
model specification using the CSDL language.
The `csdl` package provides classes that represent all of the concepts
presented up to this point.
The model specification is contained within a single top level, or
"main" model, represented by a user defined subclass of `Model`.

The `Model` class, however, contains only a _specification_, not an
_implementation_.
That is, there is no way of _simulating_ the model, given a `Model`
definition.

In order to simulate the model, CSDL requires the `Simulator` class,
which the `csdl` package _does not provide_.


## Compile Time vs Run Time

CSDL is an embedded domain specific language (EDSL).
CSDL is "embedded" in the sense that it relies on a host language to
perform some compilation steps.
CSDL is also a compiled language, which means that the user's code
cannot be executed directly and must first be translated to executable
code -- compiled -- before the user can run the program.
CSDL is also a compiled language, which means that users cannot run CSDL
code directly, but must first compile an executable object, and then run
a simulation using that executable object.
In languages like C, the compilation and execution steps are performed
via the command line separately, but in CSDL, the user invokes these
steps by issuing these commands within the same Python script where a
model is defined.
The compilation and execution steps are separated as follows:

```py
from csdl import Model
from somewhere_else import Simulator

# user specifies model
class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        # ...

# user compiles an executable object, sim
m = Model() # CSDL compiler front end and middle end execute
sim = Simulator(m) # CSDL compiler back end executes

# compilation complete
# execute simulation
sim.run()

# simulation finished, analyze data
plot(sim['x'], sim['y'])
```

Even though CSDL is a compiled language, users interact with the CSDL
compiler via a Python script, and the compilation and execution steps
are combined into one process.
Unlike interpreted languages like Python, however, the CSDL compiler is
an ahead-of-time compiler, as opposed to an interpreter/just-in-time
compiler.

- CSDL code is written in Python source files with a `.py` extension.
- Python handles the parsing and lexing of CSDL code, just as any other
  Python code.

This means that although user code specifies a program's execution, the
computer does not run user code directly.
Instead, user code is tranformed from a high level language (CSDL) to
low-level code (generated by user selected CSDL compiler back end) that
a computer can then execute.
The CSDL compiler is a three stage compiler consisting of a front end, a
middle end, and a back end.
The front end constructs an IR from user code and the middle end
performs implementation-independent optimizations on that IR.
The back end completes the compilation process, generating low-level
executable code from the optimized IR.

The CSDL compiler front end and middle end are implemented in the
`Model` class in the `csdl` package.
The CSDL back end is implemented in the `Simulator` class, which a
separate package (selected by the user) provides.
The `Model` and `Simulator` classes are Python interfaces to the
CSDL compiler.
The CSDL compiler front end and middle end are implemented in Python.
Most user code is written in the definition for a `Model` subclass.
CSDL user code is very similar to Python code, and the Standard Library
has an API that follows the NumPy library closely.
When the Python interpreter constructs an instance of a user defined
`Model` subclass, it runs CSDL user code (i.e. runs the
CSDL compiler front end), which direcly constructs the
IR; no simulation is performed.
The `Model` class then performs implementation-independent
optimizations on the IR (i.e.  runs the CSDL compiler middle end).

CSDL user code only indirectly defines run time behavior.
Instead, CSDL code defines the construction of the IR .

The `Simulator` class constructor takes a `Model` object as an
argument, generates low-level executable code, and stores a reference to
the executable object that the user can execute

:::note
Without constructing an instance of a `Simulator` class from a
user defined `Model` subclass, the user has no way of simulating
the behavior specified in the `Model` subclass, either for
analysis or optimization.

Even though Python is an interpreted language, and users do not need
to perform an extra compilation step (apart from constructing a
`Simulator` object), all Python run time execution prior to a call
to `Simulator.run` is considered CSDL *compile time execution*.
:::

The `Model` base class from the `csdl` package provides an interface
for users to define a mathematical specification for a physical system.
The `Simulator` class from a separate package selected by the user
provides an interface for users to compile an executable object that can
run a simulation.

with the ability to construct an IR directly, maintaining a
high level of abstraction that hides a bunch of stuff.
Once the executable object is constructed, the user can run a simulation
by calling the `Simulator.run` method.

:::note
The `Simulator` class is not required to define a mathematical
specification.
Projects that use CSDL will typically consist of a library of
`Model` subclasses and functions that make use of the CSDL
Standard Library.
Libraries based on CSDL should depend only on the `csdl` package.
Individual analyses and optimization problems, however, will not
only rely on `csdl`, but also on the package selected to implement
and run a simulation for a particular analysis or optimization.

## Parameters

Parameters are compile time constants that can be set by the user to
change a model definition per instance of a model.
For example, if a model requires time integration, the number of time
steps and the step size can be set without creating a new model
definition.
Parameters are also useful for setting the resolution of a mesh grid, or
the number of instances of another model to add as children in the model
hierarchy (e.g. the number of satellites in a swarm).
Parameters make model definitions more generic, and thus reusable,
reducing overhead for users of your library.

:::note
Parameters in CSDL can best be compared to non-type template
parameters in C++ and const generics in Rust.
:::

Parameters can be of any Python type, and a  `Model` definition can
restrict parameters to a set of types.

The CSDL `Model` class has an attribute called `parameters`, which
gives users some power over a `Model` subclass definition without
defining a new `Model` subclass.

This makes `Model` subclasses *generic*.
Generic classes

Other languages have the same concept as a CSDL parameter with different
names to enable generic user code.

- C++: non-type, or value parameters when using templates
- Rust: const generic
