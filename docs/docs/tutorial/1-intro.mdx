CSDL is designed for solving Multidisciplinary Design Optimization
(MDO) problems, which involves modeling and simulation of physical
systems, and solving optimization problems involving a large number of
design variables and tightly coupled discipline models.

CSDL is an Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL).
A domain specific language is a programming language designed for users
working in a specific application domain (e.g. MDO), so it lacks the low
level control that a general purpose language would have.
In exchange, users can operate at the highest level of abstraction
possible for the given application domain.

CSDL is "embedded" in the sense that the CSDL compiler relies on Python
for many of the compilation steps to generate an executable object.
The CSDL compiler takes advantage of Python so that users have a great
deal of control over compile time behavior.
Using Python as the host language also makes CSDL easy to learn for
Python users, and easy to integrate projects using CSDL into existing
Python code and vice versa.

:::note
Working knowledge of Python and the NumPy library is required in order
to write effective CSDL code.
An introduction to Python is outside the scope of this tutorial.

After this tutorial, you can become more aquainted with CSDL by
reviewing the examples in "CSDL by Example" in the sidebar on the left.

Let's get started.
