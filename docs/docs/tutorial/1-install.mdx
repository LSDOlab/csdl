title: Installation Instructions
---

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install `csdl`, first clone the repository and install using `pip`.
From the terminal/command line,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lsdolab/csdl.git
pip install -e csdl/
```

Then install a back end from the
[List of Available Back Ends](../backends).

Note that this package requires an implementation of the CSDL compiler
back end (options listed in the link above) to run.
Installing `csdl` alone will not be enough to run code written using
CSDL.

Packages that implement the compiler back end should depend on `csdl`.
It is highly recommended to create a different environment for each
back end, as they may require different versions of `csdl`.

## Updating

To update `csdl` to the latest version,

```sh
cd path/to/csdl
git pull
```

## Testing

`csdl` provides tests that are independent of the compiler back end
implementation.
That is, tests are implementation-agnostic.

To run all tests for the CSDL compiler, navigate to the directory
containing the `csdl` package and run

```sh
pytest -s --backend <backend>
```

where `<backend>` (including angle brackets) is the name of the
back end implementation.
Quotes are not required.

For example, if using `csdl_om` as the back end, run

```sh
pytest -s --backend csdl_om
```

Note that this command does not run any test specific to the back end
implementation.

:::note
The `csdl_om` package supplies the compiler back end used to
generate all output generated from examples in this documentation.
:::

If all tests pass for one back end implementation, but not another, that
is an indication that the back end implementation that resulted in test
failures has a bug.

If the bug is an indication of lack of test coverage in the frontend,
new tests should be added to `csdl` to ensure compliance among all
back end implementations.

## Tools

CSDL is an embedded domain specific language (EDSL), a "language within
a language."
Python is the host language for CSDL.
To get the best experience using CSDL, use your favorite Python
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor with your
favorite extensions.
