## Custom Operations

## Conditional Compilation

You can use Python's `if`, `elif`, and `else` to perform
conditional compilation.

Let's say you have a model of a wing in steady state flow, and different
models for the aerodynamics below and above a Reynolds number of
1,000,000.
Depending on what condition you want to simulate, you could make the
decision at compile time as to which submodel to add to your model:

```py
if Re < 1000000:
    self.add(SlowModel())
else:
    self.add(FastModel())
```

Only one model results in code generation because the condition is
evaluated at compile time.

:::note
CSDL does not offer a way of performing conditional execution at run
time.

## Using Loops to Add Several Models

A model definition can be constructed programmatically at compile
time, based on compile time constants (parameters).

```py
class Example(Model):
    def initialize(self):
        self.parameters.declare('num_engines', default=2, types=int)
        self.parameters.declare('engine_names', default=[], types=list)

    def define(self):
        # iterate over a number of engines, or a list of engine names
        num_engines = self.parameters['num_engines']
        engine_names = self.parameters['num_engines']
        r = range(num_engines)
        if len(engine_names) > 0:
          r = engine_names

        # add specified number of engines
        for i in r:
            # suppress promotions because all engines will have an
            # output with the same name
            self.add(EngineModel(),
                name='engine_{}'.format(i),
                promotes=[],
            )

        # compute total thrust provided by engines
        thrusts = []
        for i in r:
            # declare a variable for each thrust
            local_name = 'thrust_{}'.format(i)
            thrust = self.declare_variable(local_name)
            # connect thrust from each engine to a locally defined
            # thrust variable
            self.connect(
                'engine_{}.thrust'.format(i),
                local_name,
            )
            # store each variable reference in a list so it doesn't get
            # deleted when it goes out of scope
            thrusts.append(thrust)

        # sum the thrusts using standard library function, sum
        total_thrust = csdl.sum(*thrusts)
        self.register_output('total_thrust', total_thrust)
```

:::note
All Python loops within a `Model.define` definition are _compile time_
loops.
That is, the loops are used to _construct the mathematical
specification_ procedurally _within the CSDL compiler front end_, and
are not executed during simulation.
