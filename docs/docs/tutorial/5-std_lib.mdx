------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `csdl` package comes with the CSDL Standard Library.
The CSDL Standard Library is a library of functions that construct
`Operation` and `Output` nodes and establish dependencies between the
`Operation`, `Variable`, and new `Output` nodes to the intermediate
representation.
Please see the Standard Library Reference in the sidebar at the left.
