title: Best Practices
---

------------------------------------------------------------------------


This page provides some best practices to help you avoid making common
errors when using CSDL.
This section assumes you have read the preceding sections in this
tutorial.
These best practices are not required, but _highly recommended_.
If you run into any issues because of something you did wrong, the
[Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting) will be more appropriate.

## Read the error messages

``csdl`` has early error messages meant to prevent users from providing
ill-formed or physically meaningless model specifications.
The error messages should be helpful when debugging model
specifications.
Ideally, all errors should occur within ``Model``, and if ``Model`` does
not emit an error, then the back end will not emit an error and the
compilation will be successful.

## Use the same (compile time) name for the Python Variable object as the (run time) name for the CSDL variable

```py
lift = self.declare_variable('lift')
```

not

```py
l = self.declare_variable('lift')
```

This is not required, but it avoids confusion.

<!--
## Do not redefine a variable

CSDL is designed so that variables are immutable -- once a variable is
defined, it cannot be modified.
There are two reasons for this.
First, it makes code easier to reason about.
If a variable is defined once, then there is no confusion about what a
variable represents when it is used later.
The second reason is that each variable is actually a node in the IR.

Unfortunately, Python does not enforce immutability, so it's possible to
bind the same name to a new object in large code bases.

Here's an example to illustrate the behavior.

```py
class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        r = self.declare_variable('r')
        s = 3*r
        self.register_output('s', s)

        t = s**2
        self.register_output('t', t)

        s = 2*t
        u = s + 4
        self.register_output('u', u)
```

The first `s` and the second

The ``=`` operator doesn't assign the value on the right hand side to a
variable on the left hand side; instead, ``=`` binds the variable name
on the left hand side to the value on the right.
Each variable is simply a reference to an object in memory.
If a variable name is bound to a different object, then there is more
than one object that has been referenced with the same name and it
becomes unclear which object is being referenced in other parts of the
code.
Unfortunately, there is no way for Python to enforce that one variable
name can only be bound to one object throughout the lifetime of that
variable.

## Prefer Promotion Over Connection

CSDL promotes variable names from child models by default.
In some cases, promotions are not allowed, and connections are required.
Promoting more than one variable from more than one child model is
allowed if both variables are constructed using
`Model.declare_variable`.
If two variables are outputs, either constructed by
`Model.create_output`, or registered using `Model.register_output`, and
they have the same name, then they cannot be promoted to the same level
in the hierarchy.

Connections are meant for connecting two variables with different names,
or at different levels within the model hierarchy.

```py
self.connect('child_1.a', 'child_2.b')
self.connect('child_1.c', 'child_2.grandchild.b')
```
