------------------------------------------------------------------------

## (Declared) Variable

All variables are instances of the `Variable` base class or one of its
subclasses.
In order to use a variable, it must first be declared using
`Model.declare_variable`, which returns a `DeclaredVariable` object.

A declared variable represents an input to the model from either a
_parent model_ or a _child model_.
(Constructing model hierarchies is covered in detail in
the section on [Object Oriented Programming](/docs/tutorial/oo).)
A declared variable is so called because it may or may not be defined
until the model hierarchy is defined.

:::note
Any object of `Variable` class or its subclasses supports establishing a
dependency on an element or a slice of the array that will be
constructed at run time using similar syntax to NumPy.

```py
a = b[:9]
```
:::

:::important
Unlike NumPy, indexing a `Variable` does not automatically remove an axis with
dimension `1`.
This can lead to problems in user code that may be resolved similar to
[how this is resolved](/docs/troubleshooting#broadcasting).
:::

Each variable in CSDL has a name.
CSDL variable names are automatically generated unless the user provides
a name by calling `Model.declare_variable`, `Model.create_input`,
`Model.create_output`, or `Model.register_output`.

:::note
Calls to `Model.declare_variable` need not be at the beginning of the
`Model.define` method.
Since `Model.declare_variable` is used for declaring variables from
parent or child submodels, it may be used after adding a submodel.
:::

## Input

Declared variables provide a way for models in different levels and
branches of the model hierarchy to specify data transfers between
corresponding parts of a simulation.
They do not however, provide a way to enforce that data be transfered
_into_ the simulation, _from outside_ the simulation.
The `Model.create_input` method provides a way to signal to CSDL that
data _must_ be provided as an input to the simulation, and not as a data
transfer between different parts of a simulation.
This is useful for defining optimization problems, where an optimizer
updates the [design variables](/docs/tutorial/optimization).

:::note
An input to the main model in CSDL can be thought of as an entry point
to the resulting simulation, like an argument to the `main` function in
C.
:::

CSDL inputs do not have to be created at the top level, or "main" model,
however.
Values for inputs can be set for a `Simulator` after compile time
before each simulation, regardless of where they are created in the
hierarchy.

:::important
A declared `Variable` is also _allowed_ to be an input to the
overall simulation, but an `Input` is _required_  to be an input to the
overall simulation.
Remember that an `Input` object represents an input whose source is
_outside_ the simulation, and is thus an input to the _entire_
simulation.
In contrast, a declared `Variable` is a data transfer within the
simulation at a point corresponding to the _current_ model, and may be
an output of a _parent model_, _child model_, or external code.
:::

## Output

Models define variables in terms of other variables.
The resulting variable is an output, which is represented by an `Output`
object.
To create an output, simply define a new variable using basic
mathematical expressions or the standard library.

```py
x = self.declare_variable('x')
y = csdl.sin(x)
self.register_output('y', y)
```

The `Model.register_output` method provides a way to name an output.
In order to ensure that an `Output` generates executable code, it or one
of its dependencies must be registered as an output.

## Concatenation

The `Model.create_output` returns a `Concatenation` for concatenating
values.
The `Concatenation` class inherits from `Output`
An object of class `Concatenation` differs from an `Output` in that an
`Output` is defined in terms of other `Variable` objects, and then
registered, but a `Concatenation` object is registered first, and then
defined in terms of other `Variable` objects.
The `Concatenation` class also supports multidimensional indexed
assignment, which behaves the same way that NumPy indexed assignment
does, except that
[broadcasting](/docs/troubleshooting#broadcasting) is not supported.

```py
p = self.create_output('p', shape=(2,))
p[0] = x
p[1] = y
```

In [Getting Started](/docs/tutorial/getting-started), we mentioned that
CSDL variables are immutable.
This is still true of `Concatenation` because each index can have at
most one assignment.
There can be no overlap between indices used in assignment in different
parts of the code.
Some indices may be left to their default values.

:::important
You don't need to call `Model.create_output` if your `Output` is not a
concatenation of variables.

[Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting#i-get-an-output-not-defined-error-but-i-defined-my-output).

:::important
When you call `Model.create_output`, you don't need to call
`Model.register_output` later.

[Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting#i-get-an-output-not-defined-error-but-i-defined-my-output).

### For NumPy Users

It's very common to preallocate NumPy variables with `np.zeros`,
`np.eye`, etc. and then assign only some values to a NumPy array.
The `Concatenation` variable type serves this specific purpose, but it
has a slightly different API to maintain immutability.

You might be used to defining an array in Python to define a coordinate
rotation matrix:

```py
R1 = np.zeros((3, 3))
R1[0, 0] = 1
R1[1, 1] = np.cos(theta)
R1[1, 2] = np.sin(theta)
R1[2, 1] = -np.sin(theta)
R1[2, 2] = np.cos(theta)
```

In the above example, `R1` is assigned values of `0` at _run time_, and
then some of those values are _mutated at run time_.
Python allows users to update the values of any of the elments in `R1`
freely.
CSDL on the other hand, does not.
In CSDL, the `val` argument in `Model.create_output` sets the _default
value_, which if not overwritten at compile time, _remains constant at
run time_.
If the value is overwritten at compile time, then the default value _is
never set at run time_.

Let's take a look at how `R1` is defined in CSDL:

```py
r1_val = np.zeros((3, 3))
r1_val[0, 0] = 1
R1 = self.create_output('R1', val=r1_val)
R1[1, 1] = csdl.cos(theta)
R1[1, 2] = csdl.sin(theta)
R1[2, 1] = -csdl.sin(theta)
R1[2, 2] = csdl.cos(theta)
```

In this example, both `R1` and `theta` are CSDL variables, which means
the history of operations, _not the run time values_ will be stored in
the objects `R1` and `theta`.
The `val` argument tells CSDL that, unless otherwise specified, the run
time value for the array `R1` is an array of zeros with shape `(3,3)` (a
3x3 matrix).
We then tell CSDL to store a history of operations for individual
indices for `R1`.

:::note
Run time values cannot be assigned directly to an index of a
`Concatenation`.
Only individual indices of the `val` argument value can be assigned.
This is why `r_val` is created and then assigned a constant value, so
that `R1` will have a value of `1` at the index `(0, 0)`.
:::

This history of operations define the rotation matrix.
Since indices are not allowed to overlap, CSDL is guaranteed to assign a
value to each index of `R1` exactly _once_ at run time.
The indices `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,0)`, and `(2,0)` are left without a
history of operations to define their values at run time, so CSDL will
assign them whatever values were given in the `val` argument in
`Model.create_output`.

:::note
NumPy array values are still allowed to mutate within
`Model.define`, so if you need to construct a constant at compile time,
you still have that flexibility because _NumPy arrays are CSDL compile
time constants_. You can think of compile time constants as hard coded
values in the final program.
:::

Sometimes it's desirable to assign values to a `Concatenation` within a
function instead of defining a new `Model` each time.
A `Concatenation` however, cannot be created without a call to the
`Model.create_output` method, so a `Concatenation` cannot be
instantiated within a standalone function.

To define a `Concatenation` using a function, you will need to pass a
`Concatenation` variable that has no history of operations assigned to
any of its indices.
The example above may be rewritten as follows.

```py
def rotate_x(R1, theta):
    R1[1, 1] = csdl.cos(theta)
    R1[1, 2] = csdl.sin(theta)
    R1[2, 1] = -csdl.sin(theta)
    R1[2, 2] = csdl.cos(theta)

r1_val = np.zeros((3, 3))
r1_val[0, 0] = 1
R1 = self.create_output('R1', val=r1_val)
rotate_x(R1, theta)
```

Strictly speaking, `rotate_x` does mutate the _Python_ object `R1`, but
considering that the definition of a `Concatenation` must follow its
construction, and each index of a `Concatenation` may be assigned a
history of operations exactly once, this still follows the policy that
_CSDL variables_ must be immutable.
Once `rotate_x` is called, the definition for `R1` is complete, enabling
meaningful usage of `R1` in later expressions.

:::note
The default value must still be set during the call to
`Model.create_output`.
If some elements of a `Contatenation` are not set using CSDL, they will
retain their default values at run time.
