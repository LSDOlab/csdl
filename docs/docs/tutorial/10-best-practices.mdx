title: Best Practices
---

------------------------------------------------------------------------


This page provides some best practices to help you avoid making common
errors when using CSDL.
This section assumes you have read the preceding sections in this
tutorial.
These best practices are not required, but _highly recommended_.
If you run into any issues because of something you did wrong, the
[Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting) will be more appropriate.

## Read the error messages

``csdl`` has early error messages meant to prevent users from providing
ill-formed or physically meaningless model specifications.
The error messages should be helpful when debugging model
specifications.
Ideally, all errors should occur within ``Model``, and if ``Model`` does
not emit an error, then the back end will not emit an error and the
compilation will be successful.

## Use the same (compile time) name for the Python Variable object as the (run time) name for the CSDL variable

```py
lift = self.declare_variable('lift')
```

not

```py
l = self.declare_variable('lift')
```

This is not required, but it avoids confusion.

<!--
## Do not redefine a variable

CSDL is designed so that variables are immutable -- once a variable is
defined, it cannot be modified.
There are two reasons for this.
First, it makes code easier to reason about.
If a variable is defined once, then there is no confusion about what a
variable represents when it is used later.
The second reason is that each variable is actually a node in the IR.

Unfortunately, Python does not enforce immutability, so it's possible to
bind the same name to a new object in large code bases.

Here's an example to illustrate the behavior.

```py
class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        r = self.declare_variable('r')
        s = 3*r
        self.register_output('s', s)

        t = s**2
        self.register_output('t', t)

        s = 2*t
        u = s + 4
        self.register_output('u', u)
```

The first `s` and the second

The ``=`` operator doesn't assign the value on the right hand side to a
variable on the left hand side; instead, ``=`` binds the variable name
on the left hand side to the value on the right.
Each variable is simply a reference to an object in memory.
If a variable name is bound to a different object, then there is more
than one object that has been referenced with the same name and it
becomes unclear which object is being referenced in other parts of the
code.
Unfortunately, there is no way for Python to enforce that one variable
name can only be bound to one object throughout the lifetime of that
variable.

## Prefer Promotion Over Connection

CSDL promotes variable names from child models by default.
In some cases, promotions are not allowed, and connections are required.
Promoting more than one variable from more than one child model is
allowed if both variables are constructed using
`Model.declare_variable`.
If two variables are outputs, either constructed by
`Model.create_output`, or registered using `Model.register_output`, and
they have the same name, then they cannot be promoted to the same level
in the hierarchy.

Connections are meant for connecting two variables with different names,
or at different levels within the model hierarchy.

```py
self.connect('child_1.a', 'child_2.b')
self.connect('child_1.c', 'child_2.grandchild.b')
```

## Connect variables immediately after declaring them

This helps improve code readability, which may reduce the amount of time
users need to spend rewriting their models.

In order to use a varible from a different model in the hierarchy, it is
necessary to declare the variable as it will be used in the current
model.
In cases where variables are not connected automatically by promotion,
CSDL gives users a way to connect variables via the `Model.connect`
method.
Calling the `Model.connect` method before or after variables are
declared or defined is valid CSDL code.
To illustrate this, see the following snippet.

```py
self.add(
    MyModel(),
    name='mymodel',
    promotes=[],
)

y = self.declare('y')

z = f(y)
self.register_output('z', z)

# `MyModel` contains an output 'x', but it's not clear that 'x' is used
# in the current model until this line
self.connect('mymodel.x', 'y')
```

The CSDL compiler knows that `'mymodel.x'` and `'y'` are variables when
`self.connect` is called, but a user reading this code from top to
bottom will need to pause and search for where `'y'` was declared.
Consider the next snippet:

```py

# `MyModel` contains an output 'x', and it's clear that 'x' is used
# in the current model, but by the time the user reaches the line
# declaring 'y', the user may forget that this connection was issued,
# and misunderstand what 'y' represents or how it is defined.
self.connect('mymodel.x', 'y')
self.add(
    MyModel(),
    name='mymodel',
    promotes=[],
)

y = self.declare('y')

z = f(y)
self.register_output('z', z)
```

This snippet is slightly better for a model of this size, but it's still
not the best solution.
For larger models, placing connections at the beginning may lead to
using up the user's working memory, making it more difficult to
understand and maintain model code.

Finally, we have the best solution:

```py
self.add(
    MyModel(),
    name='mymodel',
    promotes=[],
)

y = self.declare('y')
# `MyModel` contains an output 'x', and it's clear that 'x' is used
# in the current model as 'y' immediately after declaring 'y'
self.connect('mymodel.x', 'y')

z = f(y)
self.register_output('z', z)
```

In this snippet, the user will know immediately where 'y' is defined and
that 'y' will not have a default value of `1`.
The user doesn't have to remember that 'y' was connected earlier, nor
will the user be surprised later by a connection changing the user's
understanding of the definition of 'y'.

## Don't redefine variables

Python does not enforce variable immutability, so if a variable is redefined (or
in Python parlance, if a variable name is bound to a new reference),
then the object in memory storing the variable data is not in use in
later parts of the code.

This means that your `Model` will lose track of the original variable.
Either the original variable will be ignored during dead code removal,
or the original variable will not be used in other parts of the code
where it should have been, leading to unexpected/incorrect behavior in
the final simulation.

## When creating multiple variables in a compile time loop to aggregate later, store them in a list

In Python, you might be used to mutating

```py
for i, obj in enumerate(iterable):
    v[i] += obj
```

use

```py
l = []
for i, obj in enumerate(iterable):
    l.append(obj)
s = csdl.sum(*l)
```

or better yet,

```py
x = self.create_ouput('x', shape=(n,))
# concatenate some variables in x...
s = csdl.sum(*filter(lambda x: True, [x[i] for i in range(n)]))
```

## Issue connections at the lowest possible level in the model hierarchy {#connections}


Instead of

```py
self.connect('A.B.C.x', 'A.B.y')
```

use

```py
self.connect('B.C.x', 'B.y')
```

within the `Model` named `'A'`.

## Always assign types to parameters

Instead of

```py
self.parameters.declare('cubesats')
self.parameters.declare('groundstations')
self.parameters.declare('timesteps')
self.parameters.declare('stepsize')
```

use

```py
self.parameters.declare('cubesats', types=dict)
self.parameters.declare('groundstations', types=dict)
self.parameters.declare('timesteps', types=int)
self.parameters.declare('stepsize', types=float)
```


## Register outputs immediately after they are defined

Prefer

```py
a = f(x)
self.register('a', a)
```

over

```py
a = f(x)

# ...

self.register('a', a)
```

This will make your code easier to read (and easier to debug).
Remember, you can always use a variable after it is registered.

```py
a = f(x)
self.register('a', a)

# ...

b = g(a)

# ...
```

## Do not append type information to class/object names

For example,

```py
class AirfoilModel(Model):
    # ...
```

The `AirfoilModel` is a `Model` subclass.
This information is already captured in the definition of
`AirfoilModel`.
Insetead, use `Airfoil`:

```py
class Airfoil(Model):
    # ...
```

There can't be two Python objects named `Airfoil` in the same scope, so
there's no risk of confusing what `Airfoil` means in a given context.

## Use Python ints, floats, and NumPy arays wherever possible, until you need derivatives

Python objects used to define a model are compile time
constants; they are always hardcoded values in the final program (if
they are present at all).
This provides a performance boost over using CSDL variables because the
history of operations for computing compile time constants (e.g.
`2*np.pi`) is not part of the intermediate representation, so no
additional code is generated in the final program.

Defining a model definition using entirely Python ints, floats, and
NumPy arrays however, not only results in a simulation without access to
derivatives, but this results in no program being generated from CSDL
code at all.

If you are using CSDL for optimization, or would like to leave that
option available for code that you initially develop only for running
analyses, you will need to use CSDL variables, but wherever you don't
need derivatives, compile time constants will give your final code a
performance boost.
