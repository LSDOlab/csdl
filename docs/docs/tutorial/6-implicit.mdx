title: Implicit Operations
---

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So far, we have shown how to use CSDL to define variable computations
explicitly; i.e. of the form $y = f(x)$.
This is not always the case, however.
Some variables are defined using implicit functions of the form
$f(x, y)=0$ (again, $x$ an input, and $y$ an output).
Unlike explicit functions, in general, solving implicit functions
requires an iterative method, such as Newton's method.
In order to use a nonlinear solver, CSDL requires defining a residual,
$r=f(x, y)$ that an iterarive solver updates by updating $y$ until $r$
converges.

![implicit operation](/img/tutorial/implicit.svg)

CSDL defines an implicit operation whose residuals are defined by an
internal `Model` object.

:::note
CSDL allows arbitrarily complex [model hierarchies](/docs/tutorial/oo)
in the internal model.
:::

The implicit operation is added to the intermediate representation so
that it depends on the input arguments, and the states depend on the
implicit operation.
The term "state" is used to distinguish an output of the implicit
operation we are defining from the output of the internal model.
This dependency structure is reflected in the language itself.

## A Simple Example

In order to define a residual, users must define a `Model` subclass that
computes residuals from declared variables.

```py
class Quadratic(Model):
  def define(self):
    a = self.declare_variable('a')
    b = self.declare_variable('b')
    c = self.declare_variable('c')

    x = self.declare_variable('x')
    y = a*x**2 + b*x + c
    self.register_output('y', y)
```

This model can be used to compute the value of a quadratic function
$y=ax^2+bx+c$ explicitly.
This model can also be used to find the value of $x$
when $y=0$.
(Obviously, for this example, the quadratic formula can find the roots
of $y=ax^2+bx+c$, but for more complicated models, the solution must be
approximated).

CSDL provides an API for expressing $x$ as an _explicit_ function of
$y$:

```py
a = self.declare_variable('a')
b = self.declare_variable('b')
c = self.declare_variable('c')
x = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)
```

This looks like `solve_quadratic` is a function that takes `a`, `b`, and
`c` and returns `x`, but how the quadratic equation is solved is
completely hidden.

:::important
`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, and `'x'` are all names of
_declared variables_ in the `Quadratic` class.
Both the input arguments `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, and the state `'x'` must
all be declared variables in the `Model` class used as an internal model
for the implicit operation.
There muse _not_ be `Input` variables in the internal model.
:::

In order to achieve this, the user first needs to create and define
`solve_quadratic`:

```py
class Quadratic(Model):
  def define(self):
    # ...

class Example(Model):
  def define(self):
    solve_quadratic = self.create_implicit_operation(Quadratic())
    solve_quadratic.declare_state('x', residual='y')
    solve_quadratic.nonlinear_solver = NewtonSolver(
      solve_subsystems=False,
      maxiter=100,
      iprint=False,
    )
    solve_quadratic.linear_solver = ScipyKrylov()

    # ...
```

The method `Model.create_implicit_operation` creates a
[callable object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__),
`solve_quadratic`.
The object `solve_quadratic` looks like a function when it is used, as
shown in the previous code snippet, but it's not exactly a function.
Once `solve_quadratic` is created, the user is free to modify some
properties of `solve_quadratic` in order to get the desired result when
calling `solvex_quadratic`.

The `declare_state` method signals to CSDL that one of the declared
variables in `Quadratic` will be used as an output of the implicit
operation.
The term "state" is used to distinguish an output of the implicit
operation we are defining from the output of the internal model.
Each state must have a residual associated with it.
Each residual must be an output of the internal model, in this case,
an output `'y'` of `Quadratic`.

:::important
Residuals may have common dependencies, but they must not depend on each
other.
Not all residuals must be used to declare states.
:::

:::note
`declare_state` automatically registers the output in the current
model, in this case, `Example`), so there is no need to register `x`,
or rewrite the name.
:::

Finally, the user needs to select the solver that CSDL will use to
converge the residuals.

That completes the definition of `solve_quadratic`.
When we call `solve_quadratic`, we only need to supply the variable
arguments.
The variable arguments must have the same name as one of the declared
variables in the internal model, in this case `Quadratic`.

Putting it all together, here's what it looks like:

```py
from csdl import Model

class Quadratic(Model):
  def define(self):
    a = self.declare_variable('a')
    b = self.declare_variable('b')
    c = self.declare_variable('c')

    x = self.declare_variable('x')
    y = a*x**2 + b*x + c
    self.register_output('y', y)

class Example(Model):
  def define(self):
    solve_quadratic = self.create_implicit_operation(Quadratic())
    solve_quadratic.declare_state('x', residual='y')
    solve_quadratic.nonlinear_solver = NewtonSolver(
      solve_subsystems=False,
      maxiter=100,
      iprint=False,
    )
    solve_quadratic.linear_solver = ScipyKrylov()

    a = self.declare_variable('a')
    b = self.declare_variable('b')
    c = self.declare_variable('c')
    x = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)
```

:::important
Calling `solve_something` returns `Output` objects corresponding to the
states, followed by the [exposed variables](#expose).
The first `Output` objects correspond to the states
_in the order in which they are declared_.
The last `Output` objects correspond to the exposed intermediate
variables
_in the order in which they are listed_ in the `expose` option.
:::

We can also define an initial guess for each state:

```py
solve_quadratic.declare_state('x', residual='y', default=7)
```

## Exposing Intermediate Variables {#expose}

Sometimes a user might want to expose variables that are defined as
intermediate variables between the arguments/states and residuals, that
are computed iteratively, but do not have a residual associated with
them.
These intermediate variables can be any registered output that is not
a residual associated with a state.

```py
solve_something = self.create_implicit_operation(model)
solve_something.declare_state('x', residual='t')
solve_something.declare_state('y', residual='u')
solve_something.nonlinear_solver = NewtonSolver(
  solve_subsystems=False,
  maxiter=100,
  iprint=False,
)
solve_something.linear_solver = ScipyKrylov()
x, y, p, q, r = solve_something(a, b, c, expose=['p', 'q', 'r'])
```

The variables `p`, `q`, `r` are now available for use outside the
implicit operation.
