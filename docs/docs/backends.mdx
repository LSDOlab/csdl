------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to run a simulation defined using CSDL, two packages are
required.
The first package is `csdl`.
The second package comes from the list at the end of this page.

The `csdl` package provides the front end and middle end for the CSDL
compiler.
The front end is responsible for building an intermediate representation
of the user-defined model, while the middle end is responsible for
performing implementation-independent analyses and optimizations on the
intermediate representation.
The `csdl` package provides users with a way to *specify mathematical
models* of physical systems, but _no way to implement simulations_ to
simulate the behavior of such systems.

## List of Available Back Ends

In order to generate simulation implementation, a CSDL compiler
back end is required.
The CSDL compiler back end is provided by a separate Python package of
your choosing.
The links below provide detailed guides for using and designing a CSDL
compiler back end.

- [csdl_om](https://github.com/lsdolab/csdl_om), which compiles CSDL
  code to an [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org) problem.
  No additional knowledge of the OpenMDAO API is required.
  All worked examples in this documentation are built using `csdl_om`
