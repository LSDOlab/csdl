------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSDL compiler back end _must_

- Provide a class named `Simulator` that conforms to the `SimulatorBase`
  API (see [Developer API](../api)).
  - The `Simulator` class _should_ inherit from `SimulatorBase`
  - The `Simulator` class constructor _must_ have a `Model` instance as
    an unnamed argument and call the `Model.define` method.
    The user does not need to ever call `Model.define`.
- Implement the entire Standard Library, and the partial derivatives for
  each standard operation.
- Implement the MAUD architecture.
- Not store a `Model` object; i.e. deletion of the `Model` object
  _must be allowed_ after a `Simulator` object is constructed, imposing
  no additional memory overhead when `Simulator.run` is called.

The CSDL compiler back end _should_
The `Simulator` class can be implemented in any language, as long as
there is a Python interface available.
For example, if `Simulator` is implemented in C++, the `pybind11`
library can expose the C++ class to Python.

The `Model.sorted_nodes` attribute contains all the nodes for a given
`Model` object, sorted in the _reverse_ order of execution.
Each `Operation` and `Subgraph` node in `Model.sorted_nodes` contains
enough information to generate executable code for the entire model
definition.
