## Introduction

To define examples used for testing and documentation, only the example
class defnition is required.
Example class definitions are located in `csdl/csdl/examples`.
`csdl/examples/` contains class definitions that are used to generate
example functions for running tests and including in documentation.
Class names must start with either `Example` or `Error`.
Class names that start with `Example` are meant to be used for testing
expected values when valid inputs are provided, and class names that
start with `Error` are meant to be used for testing expected errors when
invalid inputs are provided.
These prefixes are used for generating example functions and scripts for
testing and documentation, respectively.

The same example class definition can be used in both tests and
documentation.

:::note
It is not required that all examples be used in tests, or that all
examples used for testing be used for documentation.

## Defining Examples with Valid Input

Since example functions and scripts are generated from class
definitions, there isn't any way by default to signal directly from
within the class definition that the example script should print a
variable value in the worked example.
To make this possible, `csdl` uses the `docstring_parser` package to
parse docstrings before generating example scripts.

To write an example that prints the value of an output so that
To get values from a simulation in a test (e.g. `'x'` and `'y'`),
add

```py
"""
:param var: x
:param var: y
"""
```

to the top of the class definition for a class whose name begins with
`Example` (this will not work for example classes whose names begin with
`Error`).
This will add the following to the end of the example function/script:

```py
sim = Simulator(ExampleName())
sim.run()

print('x', sim['x'].shape)
print(sim['x'])
print('y', sim['y'].shape)
print(sim['y'])
```

The next section covers how to generate example functions for use in
`pytest`.
Later, we'll cover how to generate worked example scripts from these
functions to include in the documentation.

## Generating Example Functions for Testing

`csdl` provides a script for generating function definitions that can be
used in integration tests, `csdl/utils/generate_example_scripts.py`,
which outputs `.py` files to the directories `csdl/examples/valid/` and
`csdl/examples/invalid/`.
The `csdl/examples/valid/` directory contains examples defined by
classes whose names start with `Example`.
The function definitions in these files can be used by `pytest` to check
that the example computes correct values.
The `csdl/examples/invalid/` directory contains examples defined by
classes whose names start with `Error`.
The function definitions in these files can be used by `pytest` to check
that the example emits the appropriate error for a given invalid input.

### Defining a Test Using an Example

The `csdl/tests` directory contains all the tests.
Each test suite is a Python file with a name that starts with the
`test_` prefix.
`pytest` automatically detects test cases contained within files whose
names begin with `test_` if no file is passed to `pytest` from the
terminal/command line.

To write a test suite, create a file with `test_` as a prefix and add
the following imports:

```py
import numpy as np
import pytest
```

If adding a test case to an existing test suite, you can simply open an
existing file that already has these imports.
Then, define a test case:


```py
# Name the function, adding the `test_` prefix to the function name.
# The `backend` argument (of Simulator class) is required.
# The `backend` argument is specified on the command line.
def test_name_of_test(backend):
    # Import the _generated_ example function.
    # Note that this example imports from `csdl.example.valid`, not
    # `csdl.example`.
    from csdl.examples.valid.ex_average_single_vector import example

    # Use exec to import `Simulator` class.
    exec('from {} import Simulator'.format(backend))

    # Run the example using the chosen back end
    sim = example(eval('Simulator'))

    # Compute the desired output without using CSDL.
    x = ...

    # Compare expected output with actual computed output.
    np.testing.assert_almost_equal(sim['x'], x)

    # Compute the error for all partial derivatives in the model
    partials_error = sim.check_partials(
        includes=['x'],
        out_stream=None,
        compact_print=True,
        method='cs')

    # Check that the partial derivatives are accurate to specified
    # tolerance.
    sim.assert_check_partials(partials_error,
                              atol=1.e-6,
                              rtol=1.e-6)
```

The next section covers  how to generate worked example scripts from
example functions to include in the documentation.

## Generating Worked Example Scripts for Documentation

`csdl` provides a script for generating example scripts from the
example function definitions, which use the `Simulator` class from the
`csdl_om` package.
The difference between an example function and an example script is that
the example function takes a `Simulator` class (not an object) as an
argument so that `pytest` can call the function using any back end, and
the example script runs as a standalone script, using the `Simulator`
class from the `csdl_om` back end.
The example script is necessary for generating worked examples shown
in the final documentation.
