The `csdl` repository is hosted on GitHub and uses Git as its Source
Control Manager.

It is recommended to create a username on GitHub and
[fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository.

Before committing code, be sure to write tests and make sure all tests
pass.

Please begin all commit messages with a verb in the present tense, e.g.
"update docs", not "updated docs".

After working on a feature, push your changes to your fork, and then
issue a
[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request)
for `csdl`.
