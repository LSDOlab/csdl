# Troubleshooting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I made a model, but when I run my program, nothing happens.

Assuming you created a class that inherits from ``Model`` like so,

```py
from csdl import Model
import csdl
import numpy as np

# This is nothing more than a class definition.
class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        theta = self.declare_variable('theta', val=np.pi/4)
        x = csdl.cos(theta)
        y = csdl.sin(theta)
        self.register_output('x', x)
        self.register_output('y', y)

# After the class is defined, nothing happens.
```

then there is no way to execute the simulation because you did not issue
a command to the compiler to generate a simulation implementation or run
a simulation.
In order to generate a simulation implementation, use

```py
from backend import Simulator

# Generate an implementation.
sim = Simulator(Example())
# Run simulation.
sim.run()
# Access values
print(sim['x'])
print(sim['y'])
```

Note that the ``Simulator`` constructor calls the ``Model.define()``
method automatically.

## Why can't I print variable values?

The Python ``print`` function will print information about the CSDL
``Variable`` object, but not run time information.
This is because calling ``print`` within ``Model.define`` is a *compile
time* operation, not a *run time operation*.
To print variables at run time, the ``Model.print_var`` method is
provided, which prints the CSDL variable name, shape, and value during
each simulation run.

I get an "Output not defined" error, but I defined my output.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Either you forgot to define a value to your output using indexed
assignment, or you made your variable reference a new object, neglecting
the original output you created.

```py
# create an output
x = self.create_output('x')
# do some stuff without defining x...
# bind x to a new object returned by f; now there is no reference to
# the original output
x = f(y)
# register output, which is not the same as the output returned by
# previous call to create_output
self.register_output('x', x)
```

Also remember that you do not need to register/rename the output using a
call to ``register_output``.

```py
x = self.create_output('x', shape=(2,))
x[0] = f(y)
x[1] = g(z)
```
