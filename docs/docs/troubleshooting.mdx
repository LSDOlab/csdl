# Troubleshooting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I made a model, but when I run my program, nothing happens.

Assuming you created a class that inherits from ``Model`` like so,

```py
from csdl import Model
import csdl
import numpy as np

# This is nothing more than a class definition.
class Example(Model):
    def define(self):
        theta = self.declare_variable('theta', val=np.pi/4)
        x = csdl.cos(theta)
        y = csdl.sin(theta)
        self.register_output('x', x)
        self.register_output('y', y)

# After the class is defined, nothing happens.
```

then there is no way to execute the simulation because you did not issue
a command to the compiler to generate a simulation implementation or run
a simulation.
In order to generate a simulation implementation, use

```py
from backend import Simulator

# Generate an implementation.
sim = Simulator(Example())
# Run simulation.
sim.run()
# Access values
print(sim['x'])
print(sim['y'])
```

Note that the ``Simulator`` constructor calls the ``Model.define()``
method automatically.

## Why can't I print variable values?

The Python ``print`` function will print information about the CSDL
``Variable`` object, but not run time information.
This is because calling ``print`` within ``Model.define`` is a *compile
time* operation, not a *run time operation*.
To print variables at run time, the ``Model.print_var`` method is
provided, which prints the CSDL variable name, shape, and value during
each simulation run.

## I get a shape mismatch error, but my shapes match {#broadcasting}

CSDL variables do not support broadcasting.

Suppose you have a variable `a` with shape `(2, 1)`, and

```py
b = self.create_output('b', shape=(3,))
b[:1] = a
```

then this won't work because `b[:1]` has shape `(2,)` and `a` has shape
`(2,1)`.
Instead, use

```py
b = self.create_output('b', shape=(3,))
b[:1] = csdl.reshape(a, (2,))
```

For more complicated cases, you will need to use einsum.

## I get an "Output not defined" error, but I defined my output.

Either you forgot to define a value to your output using indexed
assignment, or you made your variable reference a new object, neglecting
the original output you created.

```py
# create an output
x = self.create_output('x')
# do some stuff without defining x...
# bind x to a new object returned by f; now there is no reference to
# the original output
x = f(y)
# register output, which is not the same as the output returned by
# previous call to create_output
self.register_output('x', x)
```

Also remember that you do not need to register/rename the output using a
call to ``register_output``.

```py
x = self.create_output('x', shape=(2,))
x[0] = f(y)
x[1] = g(z)
```

## How to deal with errors in the back end

The back end may emit error messages that look extremely unhelpful when
using CSDL.
In some cases, the back end will say there's an issue with a variable
called `'_000H'`, which is a name that CSDL automatically generates for
outputs that the user does not register explicitly.
There may be a class that the back end uses with a similar name to a
standatd library function, or an operation with an automatically
generated name.

To debug issues like this, register outputs in your model that are most
likely to be inputs and outputs of the operations that the back end uses
to generate code.
This will not remove the error messages, but that `'_000H'` will change
to the name you set for your output.
Eventually, you should be able to find the source of the bug.
This does involve some trial end error.

There are a few reasons you've encountered this error

- You used CSDL incorrectly (unlikely if the error is coming from the
  back end).
- There is a bug in the CSDL compiler back end (more likely than the
  first option).
- The CSDL compiler back end interacts with `csdl` incorrectly (more
  likely as the number of back ends increases).

If you're sure the issue is the last one, or if you've spent a long time
trying to understand the bug and you've gotten nowhere, please file an
issue on the GitHub issue tracker.
