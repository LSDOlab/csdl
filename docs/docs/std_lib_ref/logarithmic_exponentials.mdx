Logarithmic and Exponential Functions
======================================

A list of the available logarithmic and exponential functions in csdl.
Assume that x is an input vector, matrix, or tensor.

Logarithmic Functions
----------------------

- csdl.log10(x):
	Computes the element-wise logarithm base 10 of an array.

- csdl.log(x):
	Computes the element-wise natural logarithm of an array.


Exponential Function
---------------------
- csdl.exp(x):
	Computes the element-wise exponential of an array.
