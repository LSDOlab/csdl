# Frequently Asked Questions

------------------------------------------------------------------------




## What is CSDL?

CSDL is a domain specific language for specifying mathematical models
for use in multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO).
CSDL is also a compiled language, which means that user code is
translated into executable code before running the desired program.
The CSDL compiler is a three stage compiler with a front end, a middle
end, and a back end.
The front end and middle end are implemented in the ``csdl`` package,
while the user is free to choose a back end from the list of available
back ends to generate executable code.
The compilation process takes place within a Python script, and the user
can run the executable, or simulation, within the same script.

## What is the goal of this project?

The goal of CSDL is to separate model specification from simulation
implementation, eliminating overhead imposed on the model developer.
For example, CSDL automatically computes derivatives (necessary for
gradient-based optimization) across multiple disciplines without any
additional code from the user.
Complete separation between model specification and simulation
implementation allows for the language to evolve to fit user needs
with little or no additional overhead for the user.

## Why use CSDL?

CSDL is a powerful language that enables users to specify a mathematical
model of a physical system without regard for how to implement a
simulation for that specification, or which architecture is used to run
the simulation.
CSDL is especially powerful in multidisciplinary design optimization
where gradient-based approaches outperform gradient-free approaches.
Many modeling languages exist that excel at solving general nonlinear
programs, but those languages are typically restricted to a single
discipline, cannot compute the derivatives required for
optimization efficiently, or do not fully automate derivative
computation.
This leads to overhead for the user to specify a model as a single
discipline, or implement derivative computation which may be difficult
to maintain.
Ultimately, CSDL is about operating at a high level of abstraction.

## What is the difference between CSDL, ``csdl``, and the "back end"?

CSDL is a language for specifying a model of a physical system whose
behavior a user wants to simulate for the purpose of analysis or
optimization.
Like any language, CSDL requires an implementation (compiler or
interpreter) in order to generate and run software on a computer.
The ``csdl`` package contains the front end and middle end of the CSDL
compiler.
The ``csdl`` package does not provide the complete implementation of the
CSDL compiler; a separate package is required to supply the compiler
back end.
Projects using CSDL can use any of the back ends listed on the home page
of the documentation for ``csdl``.
All back ends must provide a ``Simulator`` class, which provides the
same API as the ``SimulatorBase`` class provided in the ``csdl``
package.
Conformance to a single API enables users to switch between back ends by
changing one line of code, ``from <backend> import Simulator``, where
``<backend>`` (including angle brackets) is replaced with the name of
the package that implements the ``Simulator`` class.

## Do I need to use the command line to compile my program?

Not exactly. You can run any Python script from the command line by
invoking the command installed on your system to run the Python
interpreter, passing your script as input.
When running "pure" Python code, there is no compilation step -- a
single command will run your program.
Compiled languages like C require users to issue a command to compile
the code, and then issue a second command to run the code.
CSDL is an embedded language, so compiling and running CSDL code only
involves running a Python script, but the user defined Python script
compiles CSDL code and runs CSDL code.
The steps are separate within the Python script -- users need to define
a ``Model`` subclass and instantiate a ``Simulator`` object -- but only
one command is required at the command line.
You can avoid the command line altogether by using an Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) for Python.

## Who is CSDL for?

CSDL is targeted at MDO researchers and practitioners, and as a result,
is general enough for anyone who wishes to create a mathematical model
of a physical system and simulate the behavior of that system.
CSDL is especially powerful in multidisciplinary design optimization,
where the model is composed of multiple disciplines, whose behavior is
tightly coupled.
The tight coupling between disciplines requires computing derivatives of
the objective and constraints with respect to design variables in order
for an optimizer to update the values of the design variables.
CSDL comes with an extensive STDLIB that
automates derivative computation.
Users can define their own operations and the corresponding partial
derivative for each operation as well using
CUSTOM OPERATIONS.


##  Who uses CSDL?

## How do I install ``csdl``?


Please follow the instructions on PAGE.

## Why do I need to install two packages to install the CSDL compiler?

The CSDL compiler is a
`three stage compiler
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler#Three-stage_compiler_structure>`_,
which consists of a front end that generates an intermediate
representation, a middle end that performs implementation independent
optimizations on the intermediate representation, and a back end, which
generates code in a target language, or generates an executable
directly.
The ``csdl`` package provides the front end and middle end of the CSDL
compiler.
That means that the user is free to choose any CSDL compiler back end
implementation.
The flexibility of choosing any back end means that all code written in
CSDL could in theory run on any hardware, and implementation specific
code optimizations can be performed by the CSDL compiler without any
change to the ``csdl`` package or changin the design of the CSDL
language.
Choosing an implementation for a project is as simple as changing one
line of code, ``from <backend> import Simulator``, where ``<backend>``
(including angle brackets) is replaced with the name of the package that
implements the ``Simulator`` class.

## What separates CSDL from other tools?


## Is CSDL just a Python package?

CSDL is a language, but ``csdl`` is a Python package.
The difference is that a language can be implemented in multiple ways.
CSDL is implemented in Python because Python is a popular language for
scientific computing, and it's also open source.
CSDL is also an embedded domain specific language (EDSL), which means
that CSDL is a *language within a language*; Python is the *host*
language.
The ``csdl`` package is the implementation of the CSDL compiler front
end and middle end.

## Where can I run code written using CSDL?

Consult the compiler back end documentation for more information.
A list of available compiler back ends is available
`here <../index.html>`_.

## What are some projects that use CSDL?


## Who maintains CSDL?

[Victor Gandarillas](mailto:vgandari@eng.ucsd.edu) is the main
designer of CSDL, developer of ``csdl``, and developer of the
``csdl_om`` compiler back end (with credit given to the OpenMDAO team).
As CSDL grows and evolves, we may set up various working groups to
ensure that CSDL meets the needs of our users.

## Where is CSDL headed?

CSDL is a very young project, so the short answer is, that's up to you!
We are currently using CSDL in a variety of projects, gathering user
feedback, and working with potential stakeholders to make sure CSDL
continues to grow, benefit the MDO community, and make lasting impact.
Feel free to use CSDL in your project, send us feedback, and engage
with the community.

## How can I get involved?

As a user, you can help improve CSDL by joining our roundtable meetings
every [frequency TBD].

## What does CSDL do differently?
