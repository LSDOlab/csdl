# Frequently Asked Questions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is CSDL?

CSDL is an embedded domain specific language designed for solving
Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) problems.
CSDL enables complete separation between specifying a mathematical model
and implementing a numerical simulation of a physical system.
Separation between specification and implementation enables engineers to
operate at a high level of abstraction, without the need to implement
low level algorithms, including derivative computation.
CSDL is an obvious choice for optimization problems that benefit from
gradient-based methods because of how CSDL automates derivative
computation, both at the level of individual operations, and across
tightly coupled disciplines.
The CSDL compiler's intrusive design makes it a powerful tool for
analyzing, verifying, and optimizing model code prior to execution, so
it is sure to grow in capability in the long term, reducing development
time.

## Why use CSDL?

CSDL is a powerful language that enables users to specify a mathematical
model of a physical system without regard for how to implement a
simulation for that specification, or which architecture is used to run
the simulation.
CSDL is especially powerful in multidisciplinary design optimization
where gradient-based approaches can be applied, due to their superior
performance over gradient-free approaches.
Many modeling languages exist that excel at solving general nonlinear
programs, but those languages are typically restricted to a single
discipline, do not fully automate derivative computation, or cannot
compute the derivatives required for optimization efficiently.
This leads to overhead for the user to specify a model as a single
discipline, or implement derivative computation which may be difficult
to maintain.
CSDL automates derivative computation for individual operations and
across multiple disciplines.
Model disciplines are typically tightly coupled, presenting a challenge
for derivative computation necessary for solving nonlinear programs
(NLPs).

CSDL enables users to specify mathematical models of physical systems in
two ways: a functional style, and an object oriented style.
The functional style of model specification is a style that is similar
to natural mathematical notation.
The object oriented style of model specification enables hierarchical
composition of models.
Both styles make code easier to read and intuitive to use for
multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization applications.

## What is the goal of this project?

The goal of CSDL is to separate model specification from simulation
implementation, eliminating overhead imposed on the model developer,
with emphasis given to solving multidisciplinary design optimization
problems.
For example, CSDL automatically computes derivatives (necessary for
gradient-based optimization) across multiple disciplines without any
additional code from the user.
Complete separation between model specification and simulation
implementation allows for the language to evolve to fit user needs
with little or no additional overhead for the user.

## Who is CSDL for?

CSDL is targeted at MDO researchers and practitioners, and as a result,
is general enough for anyone who wishes to create a mathematical model
of a physical system and simulate the behavior of that system, even if
optimization is not a requirement.
CSDL is especially powerful in multidisciplinary design optimization,
where the model is composed of multiple disciplines that are
tightly coupled, which presents a challenge to efficient derivative
computation.
The tight coupling between disciplines requires computing derivatives of
the objective and constraints with respect to design variables in order
for an optimizer to update the values of the design variables.
CSDL comes with an extensive standard library that automates derivative
computation.
Users can define their own operations and the corresponding partial
derivative for each operation as well using
[custom operations](docs/tutorial/advanced#custom-operations).

## Who maintains CSDL?

The [LSDO Lab at UCSD](https://lsdo.eng.ucsd.edu/) owns the repository
for the `csdl` compiler front end source code and the `csdl_om` compiler
back end source code.
[Victor Gandarillas](/community#core-development-team) is the sole
maintainer for both `csdl` and `csdl_om` (which is based on
[OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org/)) at the moment, but more contributors
are welcome.
As CSDL grows and evolves, we may set up various working groups to
ensure that CSDL meets the needs of our users

## Who uses CSDL?

Currently, the LSDO Lab at UCSD uses CSDL for a number of projects.
If you are a CSDL user and would like your organization or project to be
featured on this website, please
[let us know](mailto:vgandari@eng.ucsd.edu).

## How do I install `csdl`?

Please follow the instructions in the [Tutorial](docs/tutorial/install).

## Do I need to use the command line to compile my program?

Users write CSDL source code, compile source code, and run the generated
executable from within a single Python script
Running the Python script containing the CSDL source code and commands
to compile and run a simulation is the only step required.
Although CSDL is a compiled language, the compilation (creating a
`Simulator` object) and execution (calling `Simulator.run`)
steps are separated by lines of code within a script, rather than two
separate commands on a terminal/command line (e.g. for a simple program
written in C, `gcc main.c` followed by `a.out`).

## Why do I need to install two packages to install the CSDL compiler?

CSDL is a language, and the CSDL compiler is implemented as a
[three stage compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler#Three-stage_compiler_structure),
which consists of a front end that generates an intermediate
representation, a middle end that performs implementation independent
optimizations on the intermediate representation, and a back end, which
generates code in a target language, or generates an executable
directly.
CSDL is an embedded domain specific language (EDSL), which means
that CSDL is a *language within a language*; Python is the *host*
language for CSDL.
The `csdl` package provides the front end and middle end of the CSDL
compiler, but the user is free to choose any CSDL compiler back end
to implement a low level executable object to run a simulation.
The flexibility of choosing any back end means that all code written in
CSDL could in theory run on any hardware, and implementation specific
code optimizations can be performed by the CSDL compiler without any
change to user code, the `csdl` package, or the design of the CSDL
language.
Choosing an implementation for a project is as simple as changing one
line of code, `from <backend> import Simulator`, where `<backend>`
(including angle brackets) is replaced with the name of the package that
implements the `Simulator` class.

## What is the difference between CSDL, `csdl`, and the "back end"?

CSDL is a language for specifying a model of a physical system whose
behavior a user wants to simulate for the purpose of analysis or
optimization.
Like any language, CSDL requires an implementation (compiler or
interpreter) in order to generate and run software on a computer.
.
The `csdl` package contains the front end and middle end of the CSDL
compiler.
The `csdl` package does not provide the complete implementation of the
CSDL compiler; a separate package is required to supply the compiler
back end.
Projects using CSDL can use any of the back ends listed on the home page
of the documentation for `csdl`.
All back ends must provide a `Simulator` class, which provides the
same API as the `SimulatorBase` class provided in the `csdl`
package.
Conformance to a single API enables users to switch between back ends by
changing one line of code, `from <backend> import Simulator`, where
`<backend>` (including angle brackets) is replaced with the name of
the package that implements the `Simulator` class.

## Where can I run code written using CSDL?

You may run CSDL on any platform that your chosen CSDL compiler back end
supports.
Consult documentation for the compiler back end of your choice for more
information.
A list of available compiler back ends is available
[here](/docs/backends).

## Where is CSDL headed?

CSDL is a very young project, so the short answer is, that's up to you!
We are currently using CSDL in a variety of projects, gathering user
feedback, and working with potential stakeholders to make sure CSDL
continues to grow, benefit the MDO community, and make lasting impact.
Feel free to use CSDL in your project, send us feedback, and engage
with the community.

## How can I get involved?
