# CSDL

This package contains the Computational System Design Language (CSDL),
an embedded domain specific language with Python as the host language
that automates the computation of partial derivatives for use in
gradient-based optimization.

This package provides the front end for the compiler for CSDL.
A back end for the compiler is required to run a model.
See [Installation](#installation) for instructions on how to install the
front end and back end for the compiler, as well as a list of back ends
available for CSDL.
